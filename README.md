## Library Management System in C

This repository holds a simple library management system implemented in C language. It allows users to perform basic library operations like:

**Librarian Functionality:**

* Add, view, search for, and delete books from the library
* Register new users
* View list of currently borrowed books

**User Functionality:**

* Login and search for books
* Borrow and return books

**Features:**

* Data structures for books, users, and librarians
* File based storage for book and user data (implemented later, not currently included)
* User authentication with username and password (secure password input with `_getch()`)
* Clear menu-driven interface

**To run the program:**

1. Compile the source code (`library.c`) using a C compiler.
2. Run the executable file.

**Additional Notes:**

* This is a basic implementation and can be further extended with features like:
    * Fine calculations for overdue books
    * User borrowing history
    * Different user roles with varying permissions
* Secure password storage is not implemented in this version and should be addressed for real-world usage.

**Feel free to contribute to this project by adding new features, improving the code, or fixing bugs. Pull requests are welcome!**

**For any questions or suggestions, please open an issue in this repository.**

I hope this readme section provides a clear and concise overview of your library management system project for your Github repository.
